Recommenders report:

This report aims to detail to all team members which recommenders are we using, as well as their characteristics and limitations.

After going through a trial and error process, we stuck with a content-based model and a collaborative filtering one.

1. Content-based filtering (CBF):

CBF relies on the characteristics of items and user preferences. The system analyzes the features of items (e.g. genre, year or actors) to create a profile of the user based on their interactions. Recommendations are generated by matching the user's profile with items that share similar attributes.

To ensure a great performance, items are represented using feature vectors, while users iteractions are stored as a vector representation. Then, through some metric (e.g. cosine similarity or Euclidean distance) similarity scores are computed and the items corresponding to the higher ones are recomended.

This approach enables a high level of personalization while also being transparent. Moreover, it deals with the cold-start problem for users, as it can recommend items to new users if they provide some initial preferences.

However, CBF presents several limitations. First of all, it suffers from the cold-start problem for items (it cannot recommend items without prior metadata or features). In addition to that, its high level of personalization also means it returns narrow recommendations (leading to a "filter bubble" where only similar items are recommended). Finally, its exploration is limited, as it does not leverage insights from other users' preferences, potentially missing popular or novel items outside the user's typical range.

2. Collaborative Filtering (CF):

CF generates recommendations based on user interactions and preferences rather than item attributes, which means it assumes users who interacted with similar items in the past will have similar tastes. In general, we consider 3 different types of CF recommenders: user-based (where users with similar interaction patterns are found and recommends items those users liked), item-based (where items which are similar based on user interactions are identified and recommends those sharing a high co-ocurrence) and matrix factorization (user-item interactions are modeled as a sparse matrix and techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or Alternating Least Squares (ALS) are applied to uncover latent factors representing user and item features). In our specific case, we work following the last approach.

This model is capable of uncovering implicit relationships between users and items, while also adapts as new user-item interactions are added (enabling evolving recommendations). Furthermore, it does not require detailed metadata, as recommendations are purely based on user-item interactions.

Nonetheless, CF also presents several shortcomings: it also suffers from the cold-start problem (it requires sufficient historical data for users and items to make meaningful recommendations), the sparsity of the matrix means recommendations are less reliable and the model is hardly scalable for large datasets (especially in real-time systems). On top of that, it struggles with users whose preferences do not align well with others and, finally, it tends to favor well-known items (potentially neglecting niche or diverse options).

3. Hybrid systems:

To overcome the limitations of each approach, many systems adopt a hybrid recommender system, combining CBF and CF. Such systems leverage the strenghts of both methods, providing robust recommendations that balance personalization, diversity and scalability. As developing the best recommender is not the focus of the project, we did not consider this more complex approach. Nevertheless, we consider the option to develop it in the future if time allows us to do so.

Conclusion:

CBF and CF are foundational approaches in recommendation systems, each with distinct mechanisms, advantages and trade-offs. Comprehending their characteristics and limitations allows organizations to choose the best-fit approach or design hybrid systems for their needs. While these approaches present some limitations, advancements in deep learning, graph-based methods and hybrid techniques continue to push the boundaries of recommendation capabilities.
